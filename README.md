***I have heard a lot about using Markdown for writing and editing text, especially in the case of writing on tablets***

**At its core, Markdown is a super simple way to add formatting like headers, bold, bulleted lists, and so on to plain text. It was originally designed to be an easy alternative to HTML, and allows people to create web pages with no HTML experience—but it's also a great way to organize notes, to-do lists, and other things. It has all the advantages of plain text, but with the organizational power of a word processor. The end goal is a minimalist writing system that you can use to get your thoughts down, and then export them elsewhere without worrying too much about the appearance**


*What Markdown Is and How It Works*

 *Markdown uses a very simple formatting syntax to accomplish the same thing that HTML or Rich Text Formatting does. The difference is that it's simpler than HTML and you don't have to worry about opening and closing tags. It also doesn't have all of the menus associated with most text editing programs. To format text, Markdown uses punctuation and characters you're already familiar with.

For example, to create a header you use hashtags. So, "# HEADLINE" is a large header. "## HEADLINE" would be a little smaller, "### HEADLINE" would be smaller still.*


 
 
*So, Why Should You Use It?*

*We're big fans of plain text writing—or at the very least, writing with the exact amount of tools you need. If plain text is too minimal for you because you need formatting, but you don't want to waste time with too much formatting with the likes of Microsoft Word, then Markdown is a good in-between. It's also supported in tons of different web applications, including Tumblr, some Wiki's, and other

**Markdown isn't for everyone, but it's not difficult to learn, and you can do a lot with it. It's perfect for anyone who thinks plain text is too minimal, but word processors are too bloated**
